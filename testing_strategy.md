Here’s a more generalized testing strategy for the entire application:

Testing Strategy for the Application

Unit Testing

Objective: Verify that individual functions or methods behave as expected in isolation.

Scope: Focus on services, utilities, and business logic.

Approach:

Mock all external dependencies (e.g., database, third-party APIs).
Use table-driven tests to test multiple scenarios systematically.
Include edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, boundary values).
Tools: Use Go's testing package with mocking libraries like mockgen, gomock, or testify.
Example:

Testing the service logic for creating, updating, or retrieving books and authors.
Validating utility functions like toPgNumeric or date conversion logic.
Integration Testing

Objective: Test the interaction between components, such as services and the database.

Scope: Verify that SQL queries, repository methods, and database transactions work as intended.

Approach:

Use a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or an in-memory alternative for testing.
Set up test fixtures and seed the database with necessary data.
Validate end-to-end behavior from the repository to the database and back.
Tools: dockertest, testcontainers-go, or an isolated testing database.
Example:

Test that GetAuthorStats returns correct aggregated statistics from seeded data.
Validate that repository methods like CreateBook handle constraints and errors correctly.
API/Functional Testing

Objective: Ensure APIs function as expected and adhere to the defined contract (e.g., JSON schemas).

Scope: Test API endpoints like GET /api/v1/authors, POST /api/v1/books.

Approach:

Mock external services or integrate a test instance of external APIs.
Validate request handling, response structures, and error handling.
Use tools like Postman, cURL, or Go’s net/http for testing.
Automate API tests with libraries like httpexpect or resty.
Example:

Validate API returns 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs.
Ensure pagination and filtering work correctly on list endpoints.
Test rate-limiting or authentication where applicable.
End-to-End Testing

Objective: Validate the application from a user perspective, simulating real-world workflows.

Scope: Cover major user flows like creating authors and books, querying statistics, etc.

Approach:

Use a test environment (e.g., Docker Compose setup) with the full application stack.
Simulate user interactions by sending HTTP requests to the APIs.
Validate results against expected outcomes.
Tools: Selenium, Cypress, or Go-based HTTP clients.
Example:

User creates an author, adds books, and retrieves stats.
Ensure consistency and correctness across multiple API calls.
Load and Performance Testing

Objective: Validate the application's behavior under load and identify bottlenecks.

Scope: Focus on critical endpoints and database-intensive operations.

Approach:

Simulate high traffic and concurrent API requests using tools like k6, JMeter, or Locust.
Measure response times, throughput, and database query performance.
Optimize any queries or code sections showing significant lag.
Example:

Test how the application handles 10,000 concurrent requests to GET /api/v1/authors/{id}/stats.
Validate the database can handle large datasets without timeouts.
Security Testing

Objective: Ensure the application is resilient to security vulnerabilities.

Scope: Cover input validation, authentication, and sensitive data handling.

Approach:

Test for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities.
Validate that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is stored and transmitted securely.
Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or manual testing.
Example:

Ensure all inputs are sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
Validate that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.
Error Handling and Resilience Testing

Objective: Verify that the application gracefully handles errors and recovers from failures.

Scope: Simulate unexpected scenarios like network failures, database crashes, or invalid inputs.

Approach:

Inject faults or simulate failures during tests.
Ensure appropriate error messages and recovery mechanisms are in place.
Tools: Chaos Monkey for resilience testing.
Example:

Simulate a database connection timeout and verify the application retries or returns a meaningful error.
Test edge cases like null values, empty inputs, or unexpected formats.
Continuous Integration (CI) Strategy

Integrate all tests (unit, integration, API) into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI).
Run unit and integration tests on every commit.
Use a pre-production environment for running E2E and load tests.
Code Coverage

Maintain high code coverage, prioritizing critical business logic.
Regularly review uncovered lines to ensure critical paths are tested.
